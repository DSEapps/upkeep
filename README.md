## Upkeep
A home maintenance application that tracks important items in your home and notifies you when maintenance or replacement is required.

## Motivation
Buying a home is the biggest investment most of us make in our life times. Why not take good care of it? If you are forgetful or not well-informed about home maintenance, maintaining your investment can be difficult.

Upkeep aims to help people know what to take care of, and when.
